# Reqs: A tool for managing complex concurrent requests flow

Managing concurrent requests flow is difficult. And it's even more difficult with the complexity of Activity / Fragment life cycle. Reqs is created to deal with these issues.

- Provide a simple API to manage the order of the execution of the different requests and keep the responses with the ability to resume / pause / cancel a request flow. 
- Concurrent requests executed in parallel or in sequences can be chained together in a Reqs object and this is make creating or modifying a request flow very easy.
